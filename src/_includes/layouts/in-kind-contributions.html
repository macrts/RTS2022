        In-kind contributions are integral to RTSâ€™s mission of supporting
        MacTheatre productions. Contributions such as meals to feed the cast and
        crew or printing services to cover playbill costs enable us to devote
        more of our limited budget to production costs and new enrichment
        opportunities for our students.
