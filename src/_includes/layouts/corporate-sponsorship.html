          Behind the scenes at MacTheatre, we have a passionate group of
          designers and engineers excited to take on any technical challenge.
          Last season, their creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration
          garnered them a Heller Award for Best Technical Execution and four UIL
          technical theatre accolades. Our tech theatre sponsors ensure that our
          students have access to state-of-the-art theatre technology in both
          the classroom and MacTheatre productions. Contact us to find out how
          you can support the next generation of tech theatre artists.
